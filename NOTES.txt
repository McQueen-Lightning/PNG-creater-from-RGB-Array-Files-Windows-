CRC algorithm is not working.

the way i get file size of file called "deflated"(in pngCreaterMain.cpp) is not always supposed to work according to people in stackoverflow. keep in mind.

the only windows depended part is ShellExecuteA routine that depends on windows' Shell32.dll (<Windows.h>) in src/pngCreater.cpp
